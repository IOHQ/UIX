I know what you're thinking, <q>We have <b>plenty</b> of these already, bro.</q>. Here me out though, because this framework focuses on some niche points that others don't - standards!

This framework is designed in a way that rather you're making a portfolio, company website, product page or full web application, themes can be switched out so that no matter the purpose, changing things up can be as easy as changing a link tag!
